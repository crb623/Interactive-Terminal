# Interactive Terminal

Interactive Terminal is a custom Unix shell developed in C, designed to provide a simplified interface for command-line navigation and operations. It's aimed at those seeking an intuitive and streamlined experience in managing directories, files, and processes directly from the terminal.

## Features

- Simplified command-line interface for ease of use.
- Execution of essential built-in commands like `cd` for directory changes.
- Capability to run external system commands, extending its utility.
- Input and output redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`) to control command data flow.
- Support for command chaining through piping (`|`).
- Error handling mechanisms to assist with command corrections and understanding.

Sure, here's the revised README for the "Interactive Terminal" project, focusing on the introduction, features, usage, contributing, and license sections:

## Usage

Interact with your system using the Interactive Terminal just like any other shell:

- Change directories using `cd /path/to/directory`.
- List files with `ls` or `ls -l` for detailed information.
- Redirect command outputs to a file: `ls > myfile.txt`.
- Chain commands with pipes: `grep 'pattern' myfile.txt | less`.

To exit the terminal, simply type `exit`.
